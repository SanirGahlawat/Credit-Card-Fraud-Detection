# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model. The dataset used for training the model contains information about various transactions, including details such as transaction amount, time, and other anonymized features. The goal is to classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## Project Description
The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**. We employed **Logistic Regression** to train the model and evaluate its performance on both training and testing datasets.

Key Steps:
- Preprocessing the dataset (handling imbalanced classes, splitting data)
- Feature engineering and model training using logistic regression
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy and other metrics
- Visualizing model results using evaluation plots (ROC curve, confusion matrix, etc.)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle. It can be accessed and downloaded from the following link:
